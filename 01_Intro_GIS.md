#Introduction to GIS using Historical Data in QGIS

In this workshop, we will cover the basics of working with spatial data, as well as its main uses for archaeology. Students will learn what data types are common in Geographic Information Systems (GIS), as well as how to begin visualizing maps in QGIS, an open-source GIS software. This workshop has been developed for the Spring 2017 course "Archaeology of the Bronze and Iron Ages in the Southern Levant". 

This workshop is the first half of an introduction to mapping and digitizing historic data.

1. Become familiar with basic GIS data formats. 
2. Become familiar with the QGIS software and interface, as well as how to load and visualize layers of vector and tabular data in QGIS.
